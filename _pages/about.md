Welcome to my homepage! I am Wookyeong Song, a 5th year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) 
at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by Professor [Hans-Georg Mueller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/).
Before that, I earned my B.S. in Mathematical science and Statistics from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). 

My research interest lies in developing geometry-aware statistical methods for random objects
that take values in general metric spaces, and in their statistical applications to real-world data, including biomedical and neuroscience applications.

Welcome to my homepage! I am Wookyeong Song, a fifth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) 
at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by Professor [Hans-Georg Mueller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/).
Before that, I earned my B.S. in Mathematical science and Statistics from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). 

I am broadly interested in statistics and data science for modern datasets with complex intrinsic structure. In particular, my research focus on developing geometry-aware statistical methods for random objects that take values in general metric spaces, and applying these methods to real-world problems, especially in biomedical and neuroscience domains.
